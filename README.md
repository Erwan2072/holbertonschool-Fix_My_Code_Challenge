# Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains the solutions for the **Fix My Code Challenge**. The goal of this project is to jump into an existing code base and fix the issues without recoding everything. This project helps enhance debugging skills and improve understanding of different programming languages and their specificities.

## Project Overview

This project is **optional** and does not affect the overall score negatively if not completed. However, successfully fixing the code increases the project grade and can enhance your coding skills in multiple languages.

### General Requirements

- **Editors allowed**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Compilation**: All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **End of file**: All files should end with a new line
- **README.md**: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
